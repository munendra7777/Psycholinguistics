    "\n",
    "To understand **cognitive development** we must fist understand what **Cognition** Is. Cognition refers to all activity, processes, and products of the mind ,for example, Whatever you perceive using your senses. *Piaget's (1936)* **theory of cognitive development** explains how a child constructs a mental picture of the world. He is also known as **father of psychology**. He was a contructivist i.e. his theory suggest that children learn thing in building blocks as in constructing knowledge in bits for themselves. He observed his own children in infancy.  Certainly, child perceives the world as it is and is very different from how how adults see it. He disagreed with the idea that intelligence was a fixed trait, and regarded cognitive development as a process which occurs due to biological maturation and interaction with the outer world.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Piaget *was the first psychologist to make a systematic study of cognitive development and before him no recognisable work of cognitive development existed and the common assumption in psychology was that children are merely less competent thinkers than adults. Piaget showed that young children think in amazingly different ways compared to adults.Even though the theories proposed by *Piaget* dates back to the decades but his earliest research is still informative. The longitivity of his theories have many reasons. Some of them are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- His theories/concepts provides us the sense as to what children's thinking is like.\n",
    "- His theory addressses the topics that have been interest of many scholars, scientists, philosophers and parents\n",
    "- His theory covers a wide age span of child development i.e. from infancy to adolescence\n",
    "- His theory covers object permanance which was the resultant of his observation concerning infants' failure to search for objects if they cannot see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Immanual Kant* was his major motivation for the development of his theories, who was also interested in *Origin of Knowledge*. His contributions include a stage theory of child cognitive development, detailed observational studies of cognition in children, and a series of simple but ingenious tests to reveal different cognitive abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **There are three basic components to Piaget's cognitive theory:**\n",
    " - **Schemas** Schemas are the basic building blocks of such cognitive models, and enable us to form a mental representation of the world. Piaget (1952, p. 7) defined a schema as:\n",
    "     > \"a cohesive, repeatable action sequence possessing component actions that are tightly interconnected and governed by a core meaning.\" <br>\n",
    "     \n",
    "      - **Adaptation processes that enable the transition from one stage to another**\n",
    "        - **assimilation** (i.e. using an existing schema (knowledge) to deal with a new object or situation)\n",
    "        - **equilibrium** (occurs when a child's schemas can deal with most new information through assimilation)\n",
    "        - **accomodation** (occurs when the existing schema does not work, and needs to be changed to deal with a new object or situation)\n",

    "*For xample: a toddler sees a *kite* in the sky and calls it a bird from its previous schema and calls it a bird and mother corrects him and tells its not a bird but its a *kite* and its a non-living object. This state is known as *assimilation*. The toddler now understands the difference between *the bird* and *the kite*. This state is known as state of *disequilibrium* and the next time the toddler sees a *kite* and recognises it as a *kite* This  state is known as *accomodation*. \n",

    "- **Stages of Development** \n",
    "\n",
    "According to *Piaget* all children walkthrough four stages and they do so in the same order. The four stages are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Sensorimotor**: (ages 0-2), thinking involves seeing, hearing, moving, touching, tasting, etc. \n",
    "<br>During this stage, children go from reflex-type actions to goal-directed activity and physically interact with objects to move to next stage. At this stage *for example, children learn how to adjust their pupil for the light sensitivity.*<br>\n",
    "  - **Preoperational**: (ages 2-7), Development of language and the ability to use symbols.<br>\n",
    "    Child is self-centric; has trouble understanding another person's point of view. At this stage they learn to represent things symbolically i.e. mental imagery,drawing or language acquisition.\n",
    "    *for example, at this stage children usually develop egocentricism in them i.e. they cannot think of another aspect or cannot accomodate someone else's point of view.*\n",
    "    - **Concrete Operational**: (ages 7-11), Hands-on thinking stage.\n",
    "    Child understands reversibility, the laws of conservation, and can classify and seriate things.\n",
    "    *for example, at this stage children are able to put themselves in someone else's shoes i.e. they can take other's point of view or take into account more than one perspective.*\n",
    "      - **Formal Operational**: (ages 11-adult), develops the ability to think abstractly, think outside themselves about issues and problems in society, and works to develop an identity. \n",
    "      This stage brings up the child's potential for solving different types of problems that were impossible for them tackle at earlier stages. He says that this stage is not universal. \n",
    "      *for example, children at this stage understand that there are more realities might lead their interest to fiction books.*\n",
    "     \n",
    "He came to the realization that, children view the world differently than adults do. And, there seemed to be stages you could look at where the way they view the world changes in some systematic way. In fact he had this notion that, there's a certain ability with each of these stages that they have to grasp, and until they grasp that, they can't reach the next level and in order to properly educate them we need to detrmine at what stage they actually are. We cannot not just treat them like little adults, it won't work, because they don't think like little adults. So, he spent a lot of his life describing these stages. He theorized that the development of thinking and language can be traced back to actions, perceptions, and imitations by babies.\n"

    "- information processing approaches (Case, Klahr, Siegler)\n",

According to *Spelke* children are like *primate scientists* and argues that children are much more advanced in their thinking than *Piaget* estimated. These core knowledge systems are innate mechanisms that do specific tasks. *For example: a songbird’s ability to learn a song characteristic of their species or an ant’s ability to navigate a terrain in search of food, and a human’s ability to acquire language for that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core knowledge theory operates on two domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The domain of objects**\n",
    "    - Experiments with infants show that from an early age infants parse the visual array into objects and events. As early as 2 months of age, infants expect objects to be permanent \n",
    "        *For Example: If a ball is kept out of sight of an infant while playing he will look for the ball around him.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     - and that two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time.\n",
    "         *For example: a ball cannot pass through a wall.* \n",
    "         \n",
    "       Objects are perceived as bounded, solid, continuous entities.\n",
    "       \n",
    "- **The domain of number**\n",
    "    - Similar to our knowledge of objects we also posses knowlege of knowledge. Experiments with infants show that from as early as 6 months of age, infants can detect a 1:2 ratio change in large numbers, but not a 2:3 ratio changen i.e. they would be able to tell the diffrence between 10 balls and 20 marbles but not between the 20 and 30 marbles. By 9 months of age, infants can detect a 2:3 ratio change and the precision in detection increases to a 7:8 ratio in adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core knowledge domains have mainly three characteristics:\n",
    "- core knowledge is task specific such that each system functions to solve a limited set of problems.\n",
    "    *For example, the number system can discriminate quantities based on their ratio, but this is not equivalent to the ability to count. The natural number system that supports counting is a complex construction that requires integration from the object and number systems as well as knowledge about the relation between number words and their referents.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- core knowledge domains are summarised in such a way that each system operates with a fair degree of independence from other cognitive systems. This has the advantage that core abilities are universal and are effortlessly acquired with very little experience. One such neurological research supports the independence of core systems and shows evidence that these domain-specific abilities can be lost while other cognitive abilities remain intact. \n",
    "\n",
    "- core knowledge is made up of a limited number of domain-specific systems that comprise evolutionarily important abilities. Currently there is evidence supporting domain-specific systems of objects, number, agents and their actions, and geometry of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above we could conclude that *Piaget's theory of development* focusses on just *innate learning mechanisms and are domain general* while *Spelke's theory of core knowledge* focusses on *particular content knowledge and are domain specific*. "

Children expect transitive syntax to refer to scenes where the agent’s action is a plausible cause of the outcome.\n",
